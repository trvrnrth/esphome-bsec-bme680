This component facilitates use of the Bosch BME680 sensor with [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) via the closed source [Bosch BSEC library](https://github.com/BoschSensortec/BSEC-Arduino-library) providing additional calculated indoor air quality measurements not available with the [core component](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/bme680.html):

![Home Assistant Entities](ha-screenshot.png)

## Installation
Copy the `bme680_bsec` directory into your ESPHome `custom_components` directory (creating it if it does not exist). If you are running via Home Assistant this will be `/config/esphome/custom_components/bme680_bsec`.

⚠️ **Note**: The Bosch BSEC library is only available for use after accepting its software license agreement. By enabling this component, you are explicitly agreeing to the terms of the [BSEC license agreement](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/media/boschsensortec/downloads/bsec/2017-07-17_clickthrough_license_terms_environmentalib_sw_clean.pdf).

## Dependencies
The [I2C Bus](https://esphome.io/components/i2c.html#i2c) must be set up in order for this component to work.

## Minimal configuration
The following configuration shows the minimal set up to read temperature and humidity from the sensor.
```yaml
i2c:

bme680_bsec:

sensor:
  - platform: bme680_bsec
    temperature:
      name: "BME680 Temperature"
    humidity:
      name: "BME680 Humidity"
```

## Advanced configuration
The following configuration shows all the available sensors and optional settings for the component. It also includes an example of filtering to guard against
outliers, limit the number of updates sent to home assistant and reduce storage requirements in other systems such as influxdb used to store historical data.

For each sensor all other options from [Sensor](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/index.html#config-sensor) and [TextSensor](https://esphome.io/components/text_sensor/index.html#base-text-sensor-configuration) are also available for filtering, automation and so on.

## Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Measurement
Indoor Air Quality measurements are expressed in the IAQ index scale with 25IAQ corresponding to typical good air and 250IAQ
indicating typical polluted air after calibration.

## IAQ Accuracy and Calibration
The BSEC algorithm automatically gathers data in order to calibrate the IAQ measurements. The IAQ Accuracy sensor will give one
of the following values:

- `Stabilizing`: The device has just started, and the sensor is stabilizing (this typically lasts 5 minutes)
- `Uncertain`: The background history of BSEC is uncertain. This typically means the gas sensor data was too
  stable for BSEC to clearly define its reference.
- `Calibrating`: BSEC found new calibration data and is currently calibrating.
- `Calibrated`: BSEC calibrated successfully.

Every `state_save_interval`, or as soon thereafter as full calibration is reached, the current algorithm state is saved to flash
so that the process does not have to start from zero on device restart.
